Style:
all files should be in lowercase
split code topics into parts instead of showing all methods in one block

Basic topics that we need to cover:
code style X
class
method
file       X
if else    X
c extensions
Array
Hash
code blocks
input output
unit testing
date

we should also cover common tools like:
rake      X
rspec
minitest    x
rdoc
